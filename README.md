🧠 How It Works
1. Text Analysis Pipeline

Input Processing: Clean and normalize text input
Feature Extraction: Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF
Pattern Recognition: Identify Nigerian-specific scam indicators
Risk Assessment: Calculate probability scores

2. Nigerian-Specific Detection

Keyword Analysis: Detect common scam terms (forex, MMM, ponzi, etc.)
Context Understanding: Recognize Nigerian locations, currencies, and cultural references
Communication Patterns: Identify suspicious contact methods (WhatsApp-only, etc.)
Regulatory Cross-check: Compare against known fraudulent schemes

3. Machine Learning Model

Algorithm: XGBoost classifier with TF-IDF vectorization
Training Data: Nigerian investment scam examples and legitimate offers
Continuous Learning: Improves with user feedback
Fallback System: Rule-based detection when ML model unavailable
